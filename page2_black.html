    <p>Computing has become a fundamental part of modern society - with a tremendous influence on our daily jobs, how we communicate with one another, even how we entertain ourselves. There is a steadily increasing need for qualified computer scientists both nationally and internationally, and our programs have been carefully designed to meet the needs of the computing industry and to provide our students with a better understanding of the world they live in.</p>

     <p>  
        Our department offers a wide range of courses in many areas of computer science. Students may undertake a four year program, the Bachelor of Science, Major in Computer Science, or a two year diploma program. A Minor in Computer Science is also available, which will allow students to combine interests in computer science with core work in other disciplines. Our programs are composed of courses drawn from the systems, theoretical and business application domains, and are designed to train students in applied computer science and educate them in the social, ethical and legal implications of computing. The core courses within the program provide the student with a broad understanding of the area, while a wide range of electives allows the student to expand their studies within their chosen areas of interest.
    </p>   
    
    <p>
    Our program takes advantage of small class sizes and a dedicated faculty to provide an integrated hands-on approach to learning with plenty of opportunities for one-on-one discussion with the instructors.
