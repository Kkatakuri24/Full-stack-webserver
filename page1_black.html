    <p>Computer Science is a rapidly-growing field, generating a great number of employment opportunities. Government agencies are predicting shortages of qualified computing people that will number in the tens of thousands in Canada alone. The Bachelor of Science, Major in Computer Science, is designed to meet the training and educational requirements outlined by CIPS (Canadian Information Processing Society), ACM (Association for Computing Machinery), and IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). These requirements reflect the needs of the computing industry, both nationally and internationally.</p>

     <p>  The program is composed of courses drawn from the systems, theoretical and business application domains. It is designed to train students in applied computer and educate them in the social, ethical and legal implications of computer.
        
    </p>   
    
    <p>The program has an optional co-operative education component. To be eligible, students must maintain a grade point average of 3.0 (“B”) or better in their Computer Science courses.
        
    </p>  

    <p>The Computer Science Major will be of interest to students wishing to enter the Information Technology industry and/or graduate studies. The Minor will primarily be of interest to students wishing to combine an additional field of study with a strong computing background.</p>
